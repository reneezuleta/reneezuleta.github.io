		    MIDI Pro was conceived and built by a team of developers and musicians at  <span>abirdseyeview.net</span>.<br><br>
                    Our goal is to help musicians by providing <span>practice opportunities </span> and <span>composition ideas</span>.<br><br>
                    
                    Midi Pro is a starting point for human composers to build upon and add more complex layers of instrumentation.<br><br>
		    We experimented with several ideas and implementations and chose to use a mixture of determinism and randomness to construct MIDI sequences that can be tailored to individual preferences,<br><br>
The generated MIDI sequences can be exported for further enhancing and conversion to other audio formats.<br><br>
The app allows you to selectively mix percussion and melody tracks so you can play along with your preferred instrument.<br>	
 		   

		   <br>
	            The app incorporates:
                    <ul>
          		<li>A rhythm section to select the timing and percussion style to use.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Several preset rhythms are provided</li>
				<li>A rhythm editor is provided to modify existing rhythms or to create new ones</li>
				<li>Several options are provided to control the tempo, measure count, repeats, and wether the melody follows the rhythm beats or uses a random pattern.
                        </ul> 
          		<li>A percussion section to select percussion elements such as ghost notes and markers.</li>
			<li>A melody section to select scales, keys, chord progressions and track instruments.</li>
                        <ul>
				<li>Keys, scales and musical instruments can be selected from a list of preset options.</li>
				<li>Chord progressions can be selected from a list of preset options or can also be constructed by creating custom progressions.</li>	
                        </ul>
			<li>An arrange section to group various rhythms into one play sequence.</li>
			<li>An sound profile section to adjust the percussion velocities and/or to select a different instrument set for the melody play.</li>
                    </ul>
