    <p>
The app can be utilized in several ways by selectively enabling the inclusion of a metronome, percussion tracks and melody tracks.
Here are some perspectives on the app usage:
<ul>
<li>Solo Drummer:  practice drumming techniques by playing along preloaded drum rhythms. If you need additional rhythm options, you can use the editor to create and save additional patterns.</li>

<li>Drummer Plus: practice drumming techniques by playing along melody tracks that fit within the selected rhythm.</li>
<li>Band Style: play along the drum tracks and some or all the Melody tracks.  Four melody tracks are available.  They are all programmable to choose an instrument, velocity and middle octave.  Plus, they can be silenced if desired.</li>
	<ul>
      	      <li>Track 1 which plays a computer generated set of notes.</li>
       	      <li>Track 2 which also plays a computer generated set of notes (following or diverging Track 1)
              <li> Track 3 which plays the chords for the selected chord progression.</li>             
	      <li> Track 4 which is designed to play along the percussion Base track.</li> 
	      <li>Backing Generator: track sequences can be saved to your device or uploaded to your cloud for further use.</li>   
		<ul>
            
 			<li>So that you can reload them at a different time.</li>
	
              		 <li>So that you can import them on your favorite music editor for further processing and conversion to other audio formats.</li> 
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section id="homePageId">
<h2 class="page_title" id="Details">Home Page:</h2>
<p>
The Home page includes all the basic interface to start a new play.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The navigation bar on top contains:
	<ul>
            	<li>Title showing the operating mode.</li>
            	<li>Question Mark Icon that can be used to toggle Help Mode.<br>
                In this mode you can tap the different items on the screen and read their purpose.</li>
           	<li>Gear Icon that will take you to the Settings Screen.</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Right below the title are the action buttons:</li>
        <ul>
        	<li>Restart play.</li>
        	<li>Play/Pause. </li>
        	<li>MIDI file upload: you can download MIDI files and play them.</li>
        	<li>Create and upload a batch of 10 MIDI files which are randomly created at request time.</li>
        	<li>Upload the current MIDI sequence.</li>
        </ul>
	<li>Below the action buttons there are three Mode selector buttons<br>
	When you tap any this buttons a new sequence will be created with the current rhythm parameters.<br>
        Note that melody parameter changes are always  incorporated into the play sequence, there is no need to tap the mode.<br>
	Since rhythm determines the sequence timing we ask the user to confirm the change by tapping the mode button.  
        <ul>
        	<li>Preset Mode: the MIDI sequence is constructed using the rhythm, drum and melody settings.<br> 
		In the Home screen, select Preset, then tap the ? icon in the navigation bar  to toggle Help Mode.<br>
                Tap each Rhythm, Drums and Melody selectors in the bottom tab to read the help description for all the options.</li> 
            
		<li>Random Mode:  the MIDI sequence is constructed using randomly selected rhythm parameters and the user selected melody parameters.<br>
         	In the Home screen select Random, then tap the ? icon in the navigation bar  to toggle Help Mode.<br>
                Tap each Rhythm, Drums and Melody selectors in the bottom tab to read the help description for all the options.</li>             
		
        	<li>Arrangement Mode: the MIDI sequence follows the selected arrangement. An arrangement is created by saving a list of rhythms and one set of melody parameters to apply to all the rhythms in the arrangement list.<br>
                The arrangement also specifies the tempo to use.<br>
	        When you select Arrangement mode, you can tap the new rhythm button to create a random arrangement set: </li>
      </ul>
      <li>The play progress bar shows the play status.  You can advance or rewind they play sequence by adjusting the slider.</li>
      <li>The description text shows the elements of the play sequence.</li>	
      <li>The play control switches can select which tracks to include as well as if we want to create a play that offers some variation.<br>
	(Again, look at Help Screen on the device)</li>
	<li>The loop counter just selects how many times to repeat the rhythm sequence.<br>
	Note that if with variations is selected and not an arrangement this value will be controlled by the sequencer, and you cannot make a selection.<br>
	Once the music player is loaded the music play time is shown.</li>
	<li> The tempo slider controls the beats per minute of the current play sequence.</li>
	<li>The Tab bar buttons at the bottom can take you to the different setting pages, to the arrangement editor and to the sound profile selector.</li>
	<ul> 
        <li>The Rhythm, Drums and Melody take you the particular available settings for the mode in use (Preset, Random or Arrangement) </li>
        <li> Arrange takes you to the Arrangement Selector / Editor </li>
        <li> Sounds takes you the the Sound Profile Selectors
        </ul>
    </ul>
