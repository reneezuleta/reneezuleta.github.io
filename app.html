    <p>
The app can be utilized in several ways by selectively enabling the inclusion of a metronome, percussion tracks and melody tracks.
Here are some perspectives on the app usage:
<ul>
<li>Beat Practice:  practice drumming techniques by playing along preloaded drum grooves. If you need additional groove options, you can use the editor to create and save additional patterns.</li>

<li>Drum play along: practice drumming techniques by playing along melody tracks.</li>
<li>Band Style: play along the drum tracks and some or all the Melody tracks.  Four melody tracks are available.  They are all programmable to choose an instrument, velocity and middle octave.  Plus, they can be silenced if desired.</li>
	<ul>
      	      <li>Track 1 which plays a computer generated set of notes.</li>
       	      <li>Track 2 which also plays a computer generated set of notes (following or diverging Track 1)
              <li> Track 3 which plays a chords pattern for the selected chord progression (randomly selected) .</li>
	      <li> Track 4 which is designed to play along the percussion bass track.</li> 	</ul>
<li>MIDI Generator: track sequences can be saved to your device or uploaded to the cloud for further use.</li>   
	<ul>
            
 		<li>So that you can reload them at a different time.</li>	
              	<li>So that you can import them on your favorite music editor for further processing and conversion to other audio formats.</li> 
	</ul>
<li>Song Composer: 
	<ul> 
	<li>A set of patterns can be arranged together to create a song.</li> 
	<li>Songs can be saved and reloaded for later reuse.</li>
	<li>songs can be created in two ways:</li>
		<ul>
		<li>1. Manual:  When you hear a pattern you like you can add it to your song buy activating the +Song button. </li>
			<ul>
                	<li> You can add as many patterns as you like, you will be able to rearrange them and edit them. </li>
			</ul>
		<li>2. Automatic:  When you hear a pattern you like, enter Song Mode, then one ins the Song Mode view activate the new button </li>
 			<ul>
                	<li> A template of many song parts will be generated, again you will also be able to rearrange them and edit them. </li>
			</ul>

		</ul>
	</ul>
